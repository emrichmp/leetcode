# leetcode

Place for me to add my leetcode work to document it

## Goal
* The goal is to do 1-2 leetcode problems a day. I understand I am not very good at algo problems in technical interviews and I want to be proficient at this so I have a better chance of passing interviews.

## Languages
* At the moment I am proficient at JavaScript and Ruby. I want to first tackle these algo problems in those languages to get better at them. On my mock tech interview I failed the JS algo part of the interview. The initial goal is to be proficient at algo problems in both languages.
* The next step I want to take is to do these problems in Python. I think it would be a good way to get myself used to the syntax and make it as a way for companies to see me as higher value with a certain knowledge of Python.
